# Well hello there

> **Note**: Considering the fact that you are a part of the ArcOS organization, I must point you towards our discord server where most common discussions take place: [ArcOS Discord](https://discord.gg/ARjRM6uNqf)

### Hi new developers!
I sort of expect you to already know what ArcOS is, but if not, how are you even here? Just kidding. ArcOS is a Operating System Environment that runs ontop of the user's OS using Tauri. It has its own API and a bunch of features that I can't bother lising here. Typing is hard.

### Welcome!
You're currently reading the ArcOS Private Readme for members of the organization. As a reminder, ArcOS is a project in which we aim to create an Operating System Environment (OSE) in your browser. This readme is for those who work on ArcOS.

Oh, by the way, **Thank you** for developing ArcOS. All help we can get is greatly appreciated.

## The Policy
When developing ArcOS, be sure to follow the [ArcOS Policy](./profile/POLICY.md) at all times.

## An important note
Any and all code written in this organization, either public or private, should at ALL TIMES be accessible by the rest of the organization. Do not isolate seperate repositories from individual team members.

## ArcOS as a Desktop App
I still stand by the fact that the "immersive" concept for ArcOS (aka running in fullscreen and isolating from the rest of the underlying OS) is a fun idea that has to be implemented (spoiler alert: it's implemented :D)

With ArcOS I want to thave a backend running on NodeJS and to then connect the frontend to the backend using some kind of user specified API address. Though, I don't want to create a seperate repository for the Desktop Frontend. With another project of mine, SchoolSystem, I had a frontend for the desktop app and a frontend for the web version. With ArcOS, I want to be able to use the same `ArcOS-Frontend` repository for both the web version and desktop app. (oh this happened already)

## ...Why?

> Because. Just, because.
is the only logical response to that question, whenever someone asks it.
